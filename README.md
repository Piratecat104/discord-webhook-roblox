# Sound Visualizer

A web-based sound visualizer that captures microphone input and creates beautiful real-time visualizations.

## Features

- Real-time audio visualization using Web Audio API
- Nine different visualization styles:
  - Frequency Bars: Classic frequency spectrum display
  - Waveform: Oscilloscope-style wave visualization
  - Circular: Radial visualization that displays frequency data in a circle
  - Particles: Dynamic particle system that reacts to audio input
  - Spectrum Analyzer: Detailed frequency spectrum with logarithmic scale and grid
  - Water Drops: Animated drops that fall and create ripples based on audio intensity
  - Pulse Rings: Concentric rings that pulse with different frequency bands
  - Spiral: Spiraling pattern that rotates and reacts to sound frequencies
  - Fireflies: Light particles that illuminate and move with the music
- Adjustable sensitivity settings
- Multiple color schemes (Neon, Sunset, Ocean, Monochrome)
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Click the "Start Microphone" button to grant microphone access
3. Make some noise! Speak, play music, or make any sound to see the visualization
4. Try different visualization types from the dropdown menu
5. Adjust the sensitivity and color scheme settings

## Visualization Types

### Frequency Bars
Classic frequency spectrum analyzer that displays audio frequencies as vertical bars.

### Waveform
Oscilloscope-style visualization that shows the audio waveform in real-time.

### Circular
Radial visualization that displays frequency data in a circle with points and lines.

### Particles
Dynamic particle system where particles change size, speed, and connections based on audio.

### Spectrum Analyzer
Professional-style spectrum analyzer with logarithmic frequency scale, grid, and frequency labels.

### Water Drops
Animated visualization where drops fall from the top and create ripples when they hit the bottom, responding to audio intensity.

### Pulse Rings
Concentric rings that pulse with different frequency bands, creating a hypnotic effect.

### Spiral
A spiraling pattern that rotates and changes based on audio frequencies, creating a mesmerizing effect.

### Fireflies
Light particles that illuminate, move, and create trails based on audio frequencies, resembling fireflies dancing to music.
